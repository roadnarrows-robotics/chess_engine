RoadNarrows Chess Engine Library
=============

The **ROS** *chess_server* node provides services and subscriptions to play 
chess using the GNU chess gnuchess as the backend engine.

The gnuchess (http://www.gnu.org/software/chess) engine is unmodified
(and hence, apt-get installable).

In addition to *chess_server*, the *chess_vis* ROS node provide a graphical
user interface to *chess_server*.
